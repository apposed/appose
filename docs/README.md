# Appose Documentation

This directory contains the source files for the Appose documentation, built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

**ðŸ“– For detailed guidance, see:**
- [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) - Complete guide to this repository
- [`../DOCUMENTATION.md`](../DOCUMENTATION.md) - Overview of the documentation system
- [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to contribute

## Building Locally

### Prerequisites

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you don't have it:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml` under the `[dependency-groups]` section. uv will automatically install them when building.

### Build HTML

```bash
# On Linux/Mac
make html

# On Windows
make.bat html
```

The HTML documentation will be generated in `_build/html/`. Open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser to view it.

### Build PDF

```bash
# On Linux/Mac
make latexpdf

# On Windows
make.bat latexpdf
```

Note: This requires LaTeX to be installed on your system.

### Other Formats

```bash
make epub       # EPUB format
make singlehtml # Single-page HTML
make linkcheck  # Check for broken links
```
