Alternatives and Complements
============================

Appose is designed with specific goals in mind: **simplicity** and **efficiency** for local interprocess cooperation with shared memory. However, there are many other excellent tools in this space, each with different strengths.

This page describes alternatives to Appose and tools that complement it well.

Alternatives
------------

These tools can be used instead of Appose, depending on your requirements:

Apache Arrow
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Website:** https://arrow.apache.org/

Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It provides:

* **Columnar memory format** for efficient data processing
* **Zero-copy reads** for efficient data sharing
* **Cross-language support** (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, Rust)
* **IPC and RPC mechanisms** for data exchange
* **Network protocols** for distributed systems

**When to use Arrow instead:**

* You need cross-machine data sharing
* You're working with columnar/tabular data heavily
* You need broader language support (R, Julia, etc.)
* You're building a distributed system

**When to use Appose instead:**

* You want simpler setup with minimal dependencies
* You need dynamic environment management (conda/pixi/UV)
* You're primarily doing local IPC
* You prefer JSON-based protocols for simplicity

NATS.io
^^^^^^^

**Website:** https://nats.io/

NATS is a connective technology for distributed systems. It provides:

* **Publish-subscribe messaging**

CuVec
^^^^^

**Website:** https://github.com/AMYPAD/CuVec

CuVec provides minimal overhead memory sharing for CUDA/CPU arrays in Python and C++.

**Features:**

* **GPU-accelerated** array sharing
* **Minimal overhead** Python bindings
* **CUDA integration** for deep learning workflows
* **C++ and Python support**

* You want to execute code remotely, not just share memory
* You need environment management and worker processes
* You're working with both CPU and GPU workflows

gRPC
^^^^

**Website:** https://grpc.io/

gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework from Google.

**Features:**

* **Protocol Buffers** for serialization
* **HTTP/2** based transport
* **Streaming RPCs** (client, server, bidirectional)
* **Wide language support**
* **Cross-platform** and cross-network

**When to use gRPC instead:**

* You need RPC between machines
* You want strongly-typed service contracts
* You need streaming data patterns
* You're building microservices

**When to use Appose instead:**

* Your processes are on the same machine
* You need shared memory for large data
* You want simpler JSON-based protocols
* You need environment management

ZeroMQ
^^^^^^

**Website:** https://zeromq.org/

ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library.

**Features:**

* **Multiple messaging patterns** (pub-sub, request-reply, push-pull, etc.)
* **Asynchronous I/O** for high performance
* **Cross-language support**
* **No broker required** (though optional)

**When to use ZeroMQ instead:**

* You need flexible messaging patterns
* You require low-latency message passing
* You're building distributed applications
* You want brokerless messaging

**When to use Appose instead:**

* You need shared memory support
* You want integrated environment management
* You prefer simpler JSON protocols
* You're focused on code execution, not just messaging

Complementary Tools
-------------------

These tools work well **alongside** Appose:

Conda/Mamba/Pixi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Websites:**

* https://docs.conda.io/
* https://mamba.readthedocs.io/
* https://pixi.sh/

Appose **integrates with** these environment managers to build isolated environments with specific dependencies.

**How Appose uses them:**

* ``Appose.mamba()`` creates conda environments
* ``Appose.pixi()`` creates pixi environments
* Both support ``environment.yml`` and ``pixi.toml`` files

**Why this complements Appose:**

Appose handles the IPC and shared memory, while these tools handle dependency management and environment isolation.

UV
^^

**Website:** https://github.com/astral-sh/uv

UV is a fast Python package installer and resolver.

**How Appose uses it:**

* ``Appose.uv()`` creates Python virtual environments
* Supports ``requirements.txt`` files
* Much faster than traditional pip

**Why this complements Appose:**

UV provides fast Python environment setup, while Appose handles cross-language communication.

NumPy/PyTorch/TensorFlow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Websites:**

* https://numpy.org/
* https://pytorch.org/
* https://tensorflow.org/

These libraries work great with Appose for sharing numerical data.

**How they complement Appose:**

* Appose can share memory-mapped arrays between processes
* Workers can use these libraries for computation
* Results can be returned via shared memory without copying

**Example:**

.. code-block:: python

   # In Java
   Environment env = Appose.pixi()
       .conda("python>=3.10")
       .pypi("numpy", "torch")
       .build("ml-env");

   # Workers can now use NumPy/PyTorch
   try (Service python = env.python()) {
       Task task = python.task("""
           import torch
           import numpy as np
           # ... use libraries ...
       """);
   }

Docker/Podman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Websites:**

* https://www.docker.com/
* https://podman.io/

Containerization tools for application packaging and deployment.

**How they complement Appose:**

* Package Appose applications in containers
* Ensure consistent environments across deployments
* Combine with Appose for multi-language workflows in containers

**Note:** Shared memory requires special configuration in Docker (``--ipc=host`` or shared memory volumes).

Can I use multiple tools together?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes! These tools can complement each other:

* **Appose + Docker**: Package Appose workers in containers for deployment
* **Appose + Conda/UV**: Already integrated for environment management

The best tool depends on your specific requirements. Appose focuses on making local interprocess cooperation simple and efficient.
